				<p>A blur is visible in the distance.  It seems to be moving towards you and, unbeknownst to you, you towards it.</p>
				<p>Vision in this realm is blurred in long distances.  Meters apart you begin to see the shape of an elderly man.  He greets you amiably and offers treasures for the remainder of your bytes.</p>
				<p>Without bytes you will undoubtedly perish.  </p>

		<div id='s12'>
			<p>You hand over all your bytes.  With seconds to spare he rushes towards his packs and pulls out an ornate box.  It gives off a strange aura and appears magical.</p>
			<p>He hands it over, but before you can open it you collapse and perish.</p>
		</div>
		<div id='s13'>
			<p>You walk onwards and find a 1080p blue-ray video file.  You live happily ever after, nibling on a seemingly endless amount of bytes.</p>
